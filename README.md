# Advent of Code 2016 -- in Go!

I've been putting off learning Go for a loooong time. What better oppourtunity to practice some low-stakes Go experiments than to complete the Advent of Code calendar?

(In case you're new to Advent of Code, for the month of December, a new code challenge (in 2 parts) is posted to [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/2016).)

I'm learning and writing Go from scratch here so I expect to write a lot of terrible code but progress a lot over the days. Code reviews are welcome!
